<h2>🏠 Cost Factors That Affect Your Renovation</h2>

<h3>1. Project Scope</h3>
<p>Are you renovating a single bathroom or doing a full structural redesign? Larger scope = higher cost, but also higher ROI.</p>

<h3>2. Location Within Florida</h3>
<ul>
<li>🟢 Miami / Fort Lauderdale: High labor + material costs</li>
<li>🟡 Orlando / Central Florida: Moderate pricing</li>
<li>🟢 Tampa Bay Area: Growing demand, rising costs</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Material Selection</h3>
<p>From builder-grade to luxury finishes, your material choices can double or triple your budget. Example: quartz countertops vs. granite or laminate.</p>

<h3>4. Permits and Inspections</h3>
<p>Most renovations require city permits, especially structural, electrical, and plumbing changes. These fees can add $500–$2,000+ depending on location.</p>

<h3>5. Contractor Experience</h3>
<p>A licensed, insured contractor may cost more — but avoids hidden issues and legal risks.</p>
